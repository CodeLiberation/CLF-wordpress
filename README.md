CLF-wordpress
=============

This is the WordPress theme for CLF's website! Unfortunately you'll have to install plugins on your own. See below for more about that.

###We're using LESS
If you need a free LESS compiler, use [SimpLESS](http://wearekiss.com/simpless).

* Go into `themes/CLF/library/less`, drag `ie`,`login`, and `style.less` into your LESS compiler.
* Set each file to compile in its respective .css file in the `css` folder.

###Plugins we use
* Events Organiser
* MailChimp Widget
* Advanced Custom Fields
* Advanced Excerpt
* AI Twitter Feed
